# Assignment
# Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other 
# and the board is displayed in between turns.
# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? 
# Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
# Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
